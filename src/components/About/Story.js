        Born from a simple theory in 2022, Finmed swiftly evolved into a vital
        solution. Recognizing the challenges healthcare providers and lenders
        face due to the complex A/R. We embarked on a journey to develop
        software that could truly make a difference. Countless days were devoted
        to refining algorithms and scenarios until our software was ready.
        <br />
        <br />
        In late 2022, we successfully onboarded our first client onto Finmed's
        software. While we have much more to build, our commitment remains
        unwavering to pair all healthcare providers and lenders seamlessly.
        We're crafting something extraordinary here and eager to unveil our
        accomplishments to the world.
